# MCP

For a local checkout, install the optional `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` peer and configure your
client to run `proto mcp --app <dir>` in the project directory. Stdout is reserved for MCP.
The [command catalog](commands.md) lists local tools. Store tools accept `remote: true` and an
explicit `share` after CLI login.

## Hosted connection and consent

Configure an OAuth-capable Streamable HTTP client with `https://mcp.protohq.design/mcp`.
The endpoint accepts POST; legacy clients are rejected. Protected-resource metadata is available at
`https://mcp.protohq.design/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` and its `/mcp` suffix.
The authorization server is `https://api.protohq.design/auth`, with discovery under
`/auth/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` on the API host.

Clients register through a Client ID Metadata Document (CIMD) or Dynamic Client Registration (DCR).
Use the client's normal OAuth flow with PKCE S256; do not paste CLI tokens into the MCP connection.
For CIMD, client metadata comes from an HTTPS URL with public-routable DNS. DCR supports public
clients; native clients declare their native application type for loopback callbacks.

Sign in in the browser, inspect the consent screen's primary client identity, choose the workspace,
and explicitly authorize. For CIMD the primary identity is the metadata origin. Registered clients
show their redirect hosts and an **Unverified app** label; their self-declared display name is
secondary and is not proof of identity. Every tool runs as you within the selected workspace.
Browser sessions and CLI tokens cannot call MCP; MCP OAuth tokens cannot call the application API.

## Tools and results

All nine tools use the [generated input schemas](remote-inputs.md). `share` is a share slug,
`id` is a comment ID, and cursors are opaque. Optional fields may be omitted.
Successful results are JSON encoded in MCP text content; tool failures return `isError: true`
with the shared error envelope. Invalid or revoked OAuth credentials fail HTTP authorization.

Remote MCP cannot publish, invite, revoke shares, delete comments, approve reviews or manage billing.

## Usage and access management

Free workspaces can authorize, but tool calls return `plan_required`. Pro and trial workspaces have
100,000 calls per Editor seat per UTC calendar month, pooled within the workspace. Each admitted
tool invocation is metered before its operation, including an operation that subsequently fails.
Discovery and tool listing are not metered. An exhausted allowance returns `plan_limit_reached`
with `limit: "mcp_calls"`; it resets with the next UTC month. See the [error registry](errors.md).

Settings → CLI and agent access lists CLI devices and workspace-bound MCP grants with creation and
last-use information. An unused grant shows **Never**; authenticated MCP requests update last use.
The browser uses `GET /v1/me/grants` to obtain each grant's `id`, `clientId`, `name`, `workspace`,
`createdAt` and nullable `lastUsedAt`; `DELETE /v1/me/grants/{id}` revokes it. These endpoints require
a browser session. Revocation invalidates access on the next request; authorizing the same client
again does not revive old credentials.
